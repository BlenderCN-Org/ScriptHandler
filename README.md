# ScriptHandler
ScriptHandler is add-on for Blender 3D's text editor that simplifies some common operations, including:

1. Providing a fast way to navigate between text files
2. Allowing files to be organized into projects
3. Provide a way to quickly load or reload all the files for a given project
4. Provide a way to quickly unlink all the files for a given project
5. Allow each file to be ordered, marked as runnable, and then all executed at once

The driving force behind this add-on is that I generally develop modules for Blender using an external IDE. However,
testing must be done in Blender, which means I'm constantly reloading all the files I have been editing and going
through them in the proper order clicking "Run Script". ScriptHandler allows that functionality to be reduced to
two clicks: "(Re)Load Scripts" and "Run Scripts"
